# Axcas — Small-business website and reel agent

Axcas turns a small business owner’s voice note, prices, services, photos, and reference reels into a verified business site and original reel system. WhatsApp remains the fastest path; `/studio` is a guided visual workspace for merchants who want to choose layouts, formats, and layers. ProofGate remains the internal verification and release engine name.

The launch flow remains constrained:

1. Hermes `v0.18.2` receives English voice, photos, and text through WhatsApp Business Cloud.
2. Hermes submits typed intake and immutable assets through the `proofgate` command; it never writes Convex or release state directly.
3. A constrained renderer produces a mobile product or service site from `SiteSpecV2`. Agents never emit page code.
4. The verifier checks the candidate. An authenticated merchant button approves the exact candidate hash; deterministic policy alone may promote it.
5. Product CTAs append a privacy-safe click and redirect to a prefilled message on the merchant’s separate order number.
6. One exact, consented India/US lead batch may be approved for one-attempt Vapi qualification calls.
7. Three reel angles can be proposed; one approved plan is rendered from merchant photos with AWS Polly and FFmpeg and returned privately.
8. Hermes reports raw views/clicks and proposes—not publishes—a verified improvement.
9. Axcas Studio offers Website, Reels, or Both, with WhatsApp-linked passwordless access, append-only project revisions, private uploads, five site layouts, five human-led reel formats, and editable hook/proof/CTA layers.

There is no blank-canvas site-code editor, payment flow, scraped lead source, synthetic product imagery, automatic posting, or autonomous publishing.

## Run locally

```sh
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run dev:edge
```

Copy `.env.example` to an ignored `.env` and fill only the provider values you own. The Worker remains useful without provider credentials but truthfully reports blocked provider actions.

## Hermes command boundary

```sh
npm run proofgate -- intake brief.json
npm run proofgate -- candidate candidate.json
npm run proofgate -- verification candidate-scope.json
npm run proofgate -- release candidate-scope.json
npm run proofgate -- asset ASSET_ID MERCHANT_ID META_MESSAGE_ID image/jpeg photo.jpg
npm run proofgate -- lead lead.json
npm run proofgate -- batch batch.json
npm run proofgate -- reel reel.json
npm run proofgate -- deliver-reel REEL_ID ASSET_ID MERCHANT_WA_ID "Your approved reel" --submit
npm run reel:template:render -- render-request.json
```

Commands validate locally by default. Add `--submit` only from the configured Hermes host. `verification` mints a short-lived single-use capability for the isolated verifier; `release` creates—not executes—a merchant approval request. Metrics and approved work are available through `metrics` and `guardian`; the only unauthenticated write is the exact capability-bound verifier evidence route.

## Important paths

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `packages/domain/src/growth.ts` | Business, site, consent, approval, outcome, and reel schemas |
| `packages/domain/src/studio.ts` | Studio intent, project, reel style-profile, layer, and approval-checklist schemas |
| `packages/renderer/src/render-bakery-site.ts` | Constrained, XSS-safe catalog renderer |
| `packages/release-policy/src/growth-policy.ts` | Immutable call-batch hash and approval predicate |
| `packages/whatsapp-io` | Meta signature parsing, buttons, and template adapter |
| `packages/calls` | Consent-first Vapi squad, outbound client, authenticated callback |
| `packages/reels` and `apps/reel-worker` | Polly voiceover and verified FFmpeg render |
| `apps/reel-template-worker` | Owner-authorized Remotion compositions, private-asset adapter, and 1080×1920 render CLI |
| `apps/edge-runtime` | Public routes, webhooks, tracked redirects, private admin boundary |
| `convex/growth.ts` | Durable events, approvals, consent, guardian claims, structured outcomes |
| `hermes/skills/proofgate` | Hermes operating policy and typed commands |
| `infra/` | Credential-gated Cloudflare and AWS foundation |

## Public surface

- `GET /s/:slug` — published small-business site
- `GET /studio` — guided website/reel workspace
- `POST /api/studio/link` — short-lived WhatsApp account link
- `POST /api/studio/link/status` — browser-bound session exchange
- `GET|POST /api/studio/projects` — authenticated append-only project revisions
- `PUT /api/studio/assets/:assetId` — authenticated private reference upload
- `GET /r/whatsapp/:siteId/:itemId` — tracked order redirect
- `GET /proof/:slug` — Proof Passport
- `GET /assets/:assetId` — explicitly selected immutable media
- `GET|POST /whatsapp/webhook` — Meta verification, approval interception, Hermes forwarding
- `POST /webhooks/vapi` — authenticated structured call outcome

All remaining administrative mutation routes are bearer-authenticated and intended only for the Hermes command boundary. Studio mutations require a secure HttpOnly session minted only after a Meta-signed WhatsApp link message.

## Deployment truth

See [Production launch](docs/PRODUCTION_LAUNCH.md) for the no-customer-API-key model,
server topology, launch sequence, and initial commercial packaging.

Convex development and production are deployed with separate service secrets. The hardened no-card File Storage fallback was verified through the public Worker with one synthetic PNG and an idempotent replay; release separation correctly kept it private. Worker HTTPS, the WhatsApp GET challenge, and the authenticated AWS Hermes origin are live. R2 remains card-blocked and optional. The durable origin is an AWS API Gateway ingress backed by encrypted SQS and an outbound-only EC2 relay; one complete second-merchant acceptance run is still required before unrestricted onboarding.

See [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [provider readiness](docs/provider-readiness.md), [privacy and consent](docs/privacy-and-consent.md), and [evidence](EVIDENCE.md).
The six-step live run and exact evidence requirements are in [live acceptance](docs/LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md).

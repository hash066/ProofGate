Customer-facing product home deployment on 2026-08-13: the legacy root redirect to
`/s/saturday-sessions` was removed. Cloudflare Worker version
`bb430cfc-7458-4ad4-ac2f-d940f654213b` now serves a responsive, CSP-restricted
WhatsApp merchant journey at
`https://proofgate-whatsapp-growth.proofgate-harshita.workers.dev/`. The live response
returned HTTP 200, contained `data-pg="product-home"` and the expected journey copy,
and contained no `Saturday Sessions` copy. The page explicitly labels itself a demo,
not live merchant proof. TypeScript passed and the full repository suite passed 3
legacy tests plus 96 Vitest tests before deployment.

Meta readiness inspection on 2026-08-13: Step 1 remains completed with the existing
test number, recipient, and historical webhook events. Opening Step 2 redirected to
Meta's `Developer Platform Blocked User Error` with the authoritative prompt
`Account confirmation needed` and a `Confirm Account` action. Production setup and
business verification cannot proceed until the account owner completes that Meta
confirmation. No confirmation form was submitted and no production-readiness claim
is made.

SME generalization on 2026-08-13: `BusinessBriefV1` now accepts the constrained
business types `home_bakery`, `tailor`, `tutor`, `salon`, `home_service`, `retailer`,
and `other`; pricing may be omitted and renders truthfully as `Contact for price`.
The same XSS-safe renderer selects neutral product/service labels without permitting
agent-authored page code. Hermes' repository skill and live WhatsApp Cloud platform
hint now require inferred business type, one natural input bundle, at most one
consolidated follow-up, one checked preview, and one exact publish approval. Worker
version `7184ff46-a0cc-4433-bfd7-c602cc792e00` deployed this schema and the generalized
customer home. Live root and Worker health returned HTTP 200; the page contained
`For small businesses` and the inference explanation and contained no
`For home bakeries`. Local Hermes was restarted and returned HTTP 200 Cloud-adapter
health. TypeScript and the full 3 legacy + 98 Vitest suite passed. No non-bakery
merchant acceptance has occurred yet.

After the account owner completed Meta account confirmation, the app list became
accessible again and showed ProofGate in `In development` mode, superseding the prior
blocked-account state. The Production Setup route was then opened directly and
reloaded once, but remained on progress placeholders while the page console reported
Meta-side `Failed to fetch`. No production number, review submission, or mode change
is claimed from that failed load.

Social experiment foundation deployment on 2026-08-09: production Convex
`tame-corgi-404` accepted the append-only `socialCampaigns` table and its two indexes.
Cloudflare Worker version `6e483ee9-01fc-4492-ab01-efad4d014e00` first deployed the route at the named
`workers.dev` URL with the existing encrypted secrets and production Convex/KV bindings.
After normal edge propagation, unauthenticated `POST /internal/social-campaign` returned
HTTP 401, proving the new route is live and fail-closed. The implementation accepts
exactly three immutable reel assets/schedules under one campaign hash and one signed
merchant approval; changing a variant changes the hash. The scorer compares raw-reach
denominators and watch, meaningful-engagement, and CTA-click rates at 2, 24, and 72
hours, returning insufficient signal when the three 72-hour samples are not comparable.
Repository verification passed 3 legacy tests and 84 Vitest tests plus application and
Convex typechecking before deployment. No Instagram account, access token, published
post, insight, or automatic posting claim is made.
Worker version `0a183b3f-2376-4c36-81ef-09dcfcf3d0e8` then replaced the stale
`spike-b` health label with truthful phase `whatsapp-growth-p0`; no campaign behavior
or provider credential changed in that follow-up deployment.

Live bakery catalog intake on 2026-08-09: the allowlisted merchant sent one catalog
message and three images through WhatsApp Cloud. Hermes health advanced to
`accepted=3`, `duplicates=1`, `rejected_signature=0` before the controlled gateway
restart. The cached media comprised exactly three JPEGs, and Hermes extracted the
following supplied catalog facts: Sourdough Loaf at ₹180 with 24-hour lead time in
Hubli city limits; Chocolate Cupcakes (pack of six) at ₹250 with 12-hour lead time in
Hubli and Dharwad; Garlic Breadsticks (pack of four) at ₹150 with same-day lead time
for orders before 2 PM in Hubli. The three images visibly contain a `Made with AI`
disclosure. They are therefore preserved only as private intake evidence and are not
registered or claimed as publishable merchant product assets.

The live agent incorrectly answered the incoming bundle with generic menu/flyer and
spreadsheet options and used zero product-boundary tool turns. The failure is preserved
rather than counted as a candidate. Diagnosis found that busy follow-ups were configured
to interrupt and the gateway workspace was not pinned to this repository. Hermes was
changed through its official config interface to queue follow-ups, suppress the verbose
busy notice, use `E:\Projects\axcas` as `terminal.cwd`, and replace the WhatsApp Cloud
platform hint with the bakery-only decision flow. The installed gateway restarted as
PID `100956`; local Cloud health returned HTTP 200 with signature/app-secret/FFmpeg
ready. A real follow-up turn is still required to prove the corrected behavior.

Multi-tenant hardening on 2026-08-09: ProofGate now normalizes the authenticated Meta
sender, hashes it, and derives a deterministic opaque merchant ID at the Worker. Intake
no longer accepts model-selected identity. Policy, decision, candidate, verification,
release, lead, call-batch, reel, social-campaign, asset, and metrics routes require the
same derived tenant; mismatches fail before mutation. New sites have an immutable
merchant owner, and uploaded local asset names become globally unique tenant-scoped
asset IDs. Full local verification passed 3 legacy tests and 95 Vitest tests, application
TypeScript, and `git diff --check`. Convex development accepted the new
`sites.by_merchant_slug` index with typechecking. These are isolation receipts, not a
claim that Meta App Review or public multi-user onboarding is complete.

Hermes' WhatsApp Cloud DM policy was set to `open` through its official configuration
and the gateway restarted as PID `73604`. This is currently constrained by Meta's
development recipient controls and the signed Worker webhook; it allows multiple
OTP-approved testers without hard-coding one Hermes allowlist. A durable named origin,
Meta production review, and a second real merchant acceptance are still required before
claiming general availability.

Production multi-tenant deployment on 2026-08-09: Convex production
`tame-corgi-404` accepted `sites.by_merchant_slug` and the tenant-aware functions with
schema validation and typechecking. Cloudflare Worker version
`fb7be906-ed7c-466d-ac4c-8a6539f7b520` deployed to the named `workers.dev` URL.
Post-deploy checks returned HTTP 200 with phase `whatsapp-growth-p0`; anonymous intake
returned 401, authenticated intake without a sender returned 400, and an authenticated
sender presenting a forged merchant ID returned 403 before schema persistence. Local
Hermes health remained HTTP 200. These checks prove the live boundary fails closed;
they do not prove a second merchant completed onboarding.

Installed Hermes source review confirms gateway turns bind
`HERMES_SESSION_USER_ID`, platform, message ID, and chat identity through task-local
context variables, and its local subprocess bridge injects those values into each
terminal command without sharing a process-global merchant identity. This supports the
ProofGate CLI's per-message sender header under concurrent merchant sessions. It is
source/runtime-contract evidence; the second-merchant live test remains open.

Decision-policy deployment on 2026-08-09: production Convex `tame-corgi-404`
accepted the append-only `decisionPolicies` table and its two indexes. Worker version
`63457ccc-d9a3-415f-8865-60c28d5aae32` deployed at
`https://proofgate-whatsapp-growth.proofgate-harshita.workers.dev`. Public health
returned HTTP 200; unauthenticated policy access returned HTTP 401; an authenticated
request for the deliberately absent `policy-smoke` merchant returned HTTP 409 with
`merchant_policy_not_configured`. Application TypeScript, Convex TypeScript, 3 legacy
tests, and 75 Vitest tests passed; `git diff --check` passed. These receipts prove the
deployed decision boundary and fail-closed missing-policy behavior. They do not prove
a real merchant policy or autonomous merchant action; those remain pending complete
merchant intake.

The same Worker deployment preserved all 11 encrypted secrets and the Convex/KV
bindings, but—as expected from its local configuration—did not preserve the prior
API-added plain-text `HERMES_ORIGIN_URL`. The still-running foundation tunnel
`https://sara-version-try-vic.trycloudflare.com` returned HTTP 200 health with the
official WhatsApp Cloud adapter. Its URL was therefore stored under KV key
`hermes_origin`, which the Worker already uses as its durable configuration fallback;
a confirming remote KV read matched exactly. This restores forwarding configuration
without another code deployment. It remains a quick tunnel, not an onboarding-grade
origin, and no synthetic or live message was sent during this check.

WhatsApp ingress diagnosis on 2026-08-09 found the app-level WABA webhook callback
active at the public Worker, and the WABA `subscribed_apps` edge included ProofGate,
but the subscription returned no fields. A Graph API update added the required
`messages` field; the confirming read returned active callback plus
`fields=[{name: messages, version: v26.0}]`. A signed, non-allowlisted synthetic
fixture was then replayed twice through the public Worker. Both requests returned HTTP
200 and Hermes' duplicate counter increased from 1 to 2 while `accepted` remained 0,
which is expected because authorization gating drops the fixture sender before the
accepted counter. This proves the Worker/KV/tunnel/Hermes raw-body path without
contacting a real user. A fresh real merchant `START` message is still required for
the live accepted receipt.

Live WhatsApp ingress passed on 2026-08-09 after the `messages` subscription fix.
The allowlisted merchant sent `START`; Hermes logged the inbound WhatsApp Cloud turn
for merchant display name `Harshita`, health incremented to `accepted=1` with zero
signature rejections, the agent completed one model turn, and the Cloud adapter sent a
65-character reply that the merchant supplied as a WhatsApp screenshot. This is the
first real Meta → Worker → KV origin → quick tunnel → Hermes → Meta reply receipt. The
initial reply was generic, so it is ingress evidence rather than bakery-intake proof.

The merchant chat is now persisted as `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_HOME_CHANNEL` without recording
the raw WA-ID here. The ProofGate skill description and Hermes WhatsApp Cloud platform
hint now bind `START`, `START BAKERY`, photos, prices, and voice notes to the bakery
onboarding flow and explicitly forbid generic-assistant responses. Hermes was moved
from the unmanaged foreground process to its installed Windows-login gateway and
restarted healthy; the channel directory reports one WhatsApp Cloud home target and
the foundation tunnel remains healthy. A separate-process `hermes send` attempt was
preserved as a failure: the installed Cloud adapter has no standalone sender function,
so proactive CLI delivery is unavailable even while the live gateway is connected.
No outbound onboarding message is claimed from that failed attempt.

Provider foundation update on 2026-08-08: Convex development deployment
`earnest-mandrill-823` (`https://earnest-mandrill-823.convex.cloud`) completed
`convex dev --once` with typechecking, and production deployment `tame-corgi-404`
(`https://tame-corgi-404.convex.cloud`) completed `convex deploy -y` with typechecking.
`PROOFGATE_SERVICE_SECRET` is configured separately on both; no secret value is stored
here. Cloudflare authentication succeeded and KV namespace `PROOFGATE_CONFIG` was
created with ID `bfed66f79c9a4e66adf345f4dce3c113`; Wrangler now binds that exact ID.
These receipts do not prove a Worker, R2 bucket, public site, webhook, or live event.
The 2026-08-08 repository re-audit passed application and Convex TypeScript checks,
3 legacy tests plus 57 Vitest tests, and a Wrangler dry run that resolved the exact KV
binding plus the declared R2 bucket binding. The acceptance preflight remained blocked
because live runtime/provider variables are absent and the local URL intentionally
selects development rather than production.

Vapi foundation evidence on 2026-08-08: active free US number `+17609748059` has
provider ID `3a84a4af-53a6-4baa-9eed-ace2f0a73731`. Consent assistant
`e7210ebf-91f8-48eb-8cf9-6587b91fe88e` has recording, logging, and transcript all
disabled. Qualification assistant `f48272d7-fc58-4433-9b0a-8b51ecdbda10` has
recording, logging, and transcript enabled. Squad
`492a8fae-b1ec-4d60-b221-1d7115a53eef` has exactly two members and a consent-first
handoff. The API key was verified and persisted outside the repository. These are
provider configuration receipts only: no call was placed, no lead was contacted, and
neither consent outcome has live acceptance evidence yet.

Account-gated provider audit on 2026-08-08: Meta developer registration completed and
business portfolio `ProofGate` (`911844841419654`) was created, but the portfolio is
unverified. WhatsApp app creation reached the final Overview; no Meta app was created
because the account owner must personally review the Meta Platform Terms and Developer
Policies and click **Create app**. Cloudflare R2 activation reached its secure billing
page but remains inactive pending card/address entry and two billing confirmations.
AWS CloudFormation access remains blocked by incomplete/free account setup: payment
method, identity, and support-plan activation are required and AWS states activation
may take up to 24 hours. No R2 bucket, Worker, AWS stack, Meta app, call, or message was
created or sent beyond creation of the Meta business portfolio.

No-card storage and Worker deployment update on 2026-08-08: the Convex File Storage
foundation fallback was implemented with a 16 MiB cap, file-signature checks, Convex
metadata SHA-256/size/content-type validation, and rejection of cross-merchant or
backend collisions. Application and Convex typechecks, the Wrangler dry run, and the
then-current 66-test suite passed. Production Convex deployment `tame-corgi-404` deployed successfully
after the storage policy module was renamed to `asset_policy`.

Cloudflare Worker `proofgate-whatsapp-growth` deployed from code version
`d1c1a59b-761f-4e66-9c2d-3f73ba4289e0`; the current secret-change deployment is
`927f1614-6b2f-42cc-8120-8d143f80ab85` at
`https://proofgate-whatsapp-growth.proofgate-harshita.workers.dev`. The account
subdomain and script were enabled through the Cloudflare API; the deployment has the
created KV binding, production Convex configuration, and eight runtime secrets. Secret
values are not recorded. DNS resolves and the Cloudflare control plane reports the
script enabled, but the initial public HTTPS check failed during the TLS handshake.
That initial result was control-plane evidence only and was superseded by the successful
foundation checks recorded immediately below. R2 remains unactivated and no R2 bucket
is claimed; the foundation fallback uses Convex File Storage.

No-R2 fallback verification completed on 2026-08-08 against production Convex
`tame-corgi-404` through
`https://proofgate-whatsapp-growth.proofgate-harshita.workers.dev`. Synthetic 1×1 PNG
asset `foundation_asset_verified_20260808` returned HTTP 201 with `inserted=true` and
the Convex backend; an exact replay returned HTTP 201 with `inserted=false`. The public
asset route returned HTTP 404 because this asset is not selected by a promoted
production `SiteSpec`, which is the expected release/publish separation. The foundation
proof request returned HTTP 200, and the WhatsApp GET verification handshake returned
HTTP 200 with the exact challenge. These checks verify the infrastructure foundation,
not merchant intake or messaging.

Current local verification is 3 legacy tests plus 64 Vitest tests, with application
and Convex typechecks and the Wrangler dry run passing. Failed-registration test cases
may have left unregistered orphan objects in Convex File Storage; those objects are
cleanup debt and are not live proof. R2 remains unactivated/card-blocked and is optional
later, not required for the current foundation path.

Provider continuation audit on 2026-08-08: Meta's new-app flow is at the final
Overview for app name `ProofGate`, with only **Connect with customers through
WhatsApp** selected and unverified business portfolio `ProofGate` connected. The UI
identified no additional requirements. The final **Create app** button explicitly
accepts the Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and has not been clicked.
Consequently there is no Meta app ID, app secret, WhatsApp number, registered webhook,
or message receipt.

AWS console access in `ap-south-1` redirected to `/billing/signup/incomplete` and lists
payment method, identity verification, and support-plan setup as incomplete. No AWS
resource was created. Local Hermes remains verified at `v0.18.2` with the repository
skill linked/enabled, but the official Cloud adapter still has no `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_*`
configuration. Official cloudflared `2026.7.3` was downloaded to
`C:\Users\asus\AppData\Local\ProofGate\bin\cloudflared.exe`; SHA-256
`8635da433b6df8194746e88ed9d2589566c20e38bfc2a80e431a348b7c765841` matched the
official release. The binary has not been started, no tunnel or origin exists, and this
is readiness evidence only—not Hermes deployment or live messaging.

Authenticated Wrangler continuation recheck confirmed exactly eight remote Worker
secret names: `HERMES_PROXY_SECRET`, `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `PROOFGATE_DATA_KEY`,
`PROOFGATE_SERVICE_SECRET`, `VAPI_API_KEY`, `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `VAPI_SQUAD_ID`,
and `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Values were not read or recorded. Required Meta secrets
`META_APP_SECRET`, `META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, and `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` are absent. KV lookup
for `hermes_origin` returned 404 Not Found, and no Worker Hermes origin is set. The
successful GET challenge therefore does not prove signed POST verification, Meta send,
or Hermes forwarding; all three remain blocked and no message was sent.

Latest Meta state on 2026-08-08: unpublished app `ProofGate` exists with App ID
`2349611939193122` under business portfolio `911844841419654`, and the app dashboard is
reachable. WhatsApp customization is at its initial **Continue** screen, offering a
test number while explicitly requiring acceptance of Facebook Terms for WhatsApp
Business and Meta Hosting Terms for Cloud API. Continue was not clicked. App Settings
Basic confirmed the App ID and displayed only a masked App Secret. Selecting **Show**
requested password re-entry; no password was entered, and no app secret was read or
stored. No WABA, test phone, Phone Number ID, access token, webhook registration, or
message exists. AWS work remains deferred by user direction. This supersedes the prior
no-app state but does not establish WhatsApp readiness.

Meta continuation on 2026-08-08: the WhatsApp Business and Meta Hosting terms were
accepted. The app secret was retrieved from Meta and stored only as encrypted Worker
secret `META_APP_SECRET`; its value is not present in this repository or ledger. Meta's
API-testing credential panel remained stuck on Loading/progress after direct navigation
and one reload, while the browser console reported `Failed to fetch`. Consequently no
Phone Number ID, access token, WABA ID, webhook registration, or live message was
obtained. This advances signature-secret readiness only and is not WhatsApp acceptance.

Meta credential-panel continuation on 2026-08-08: the API-testing panel ultimately
loaded and showed verified test number `+1 (555) 653-7153`, Phone Number ID
`1322968257556615`, and WABA ID `1488251739723645`. `META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` is now stored
as an encrypted Worker secret; its value is recorded here only because the provider ID
is a non-secret resource identifier. Access token status remains **Not generated yet**.
Multiple automated activation attempts produced no token and no popup, so
`META_ACCESS_TOKEN`, webhook registration, and live WhatsApp messaging remain blocked.
No app-secret value is included in this ledger.

Meta webhook continuation on 2026-08-08: a real public GET challenge was sent to the
`workers.dev` callback using the actual stored `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`; the token was not
printed or recorded. The Worker returned HTTP 200 and the response matched the
challenge exactly. Meta Step 2 was filled with that callback and verify token. The
automated save interaction redirected to `permissions#auto_subscribe`, but Meta's UI
became unresponsive before an authoritative saved state or **Remove subscription**
control could be observed. The endpoint handshake is passed; Meta webhook registration
remains unconfirmed. No signed POST or message receipt exists.

Meta/Hermes foundation continuation on 2026-08-08: two generated Meta user tokens both
debugged valid for app `2349611939193122` with `public_profile`,
`whatsapp_business_management`, and `whatsapp_business_messaging`. The selected
short-lived token expiring `2026-08-08T18:00:00Z` was successfully exchanged through
Meta OAuth for a valid extended user token expiring `2026-10-07T16:53:08Z` with the
same WhatsApp permissions. Worker `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` was rotated to the extended token;
Hermes configuration was updated and its gateway restarted. No token value is stored
in this repository or ledger.

Graph phone lookup returned HTTP 200 for test number `+1 555-653-7153` / Phone Number
ID `1322968257556615`. Meta app subscriptions now show an active
`whatsapp_business_account` callback exactly at the public Worker `/whatsapp/webhook`.
WABA `subscribed_apps` POST succeeded, and the confirming GET lists ProofGate app
`2349611939193122`. This supersedes the earlier unconfirmed-subscription state.

Local Hermes `v0.18.2` official Cloud adapter is configured with its required
phone/token/app-secret/app-id/WABA/verify-token/API-v26 fields. Two existing exact
legacy allowed-user identities were copied into the Cloud allowlist without recording
their values. The gateway runs on `127.0.0.1:8090`; local health returned HTTP 200 and
the challenge matched. Official cloudflared is running at foundation quick tunnel
`https://pursue-campus-cordless-developers.trycloudflare.com`, whose health and
challenge both returned HTTP 200. Worker `HERMES_ORIGIN_URL` points to that origin.

A signed synthetic Worker-to-Hermes POST initially returned HTTP 500 during
propagation; retry, and a post-token-rotation retry, returned HTTP 200 with an empty
response. These are synthetic transport checks—not live Meta proof. No WhatsApp message
was sent and no live signed Meta delivery was observed. The quick tunnel is
foundation-only; a named durable origin is required before external onboarding. The
full suite remains 67/67 passing from the prior verified turn.

Foundation runtime refresh on 2026-08-09: the previous quick tunnel had expired and the
gateway was stopped. The obsolete Baileys adapter was explicitly disabled with Hermes'
configuration command while the official WhatsApp Cloud adapter remained configured.
Hermes `v0.18.2` was restarted on `127.0.0.1:8090`; local health returned HTTP 200 with
platform `whatsapp_cloud`, configured verification/app-secret state, FFmpeg present,
and zero accepted live messages. A new foundation-only cloudflared origin,
`https://flag-examinations-isa-valuation.trycloudflare.com`, returned HTTP 200 health.

The signed-in Cloudflare dashboard showed the old origin but kept its Deploy control
disabled after a valid edit. The authenticated official Worker settings API was used
instead: a PATCH replaced only `HERMES_ORIGIN_URL` and inherited every other binding
from the latest version. A confirming GET returned all 15 original bindings, including
the unchanged secret and KV bindings, and the new origin. Tunnel health and Worker
health both returned HTTP 200. A newly signed **synthetic** Worker-to-Hermes webhook
POST returned HTTP 200 with an empty body. This proves the refreshed transport only;
it is not a Meta delivery or merchant intake.

Meta Graph phone lookup again returned test number `+1 555-653-7153`; the stored token
identified app `ProofGate` (`2349611939193122`). WABA subscription POST returned
`success: true`, and the confirming GET included ProofGate in the nested
`whatsapp_business_api_data` entries. The Meta testing UI currently has no recipient
number selected or stored, so its Send message control is disabled and adding one
requires the merchant's phone number plus Meta's verification step. No message was
sent, no provider message ID exists, and live signed delivery remains open.

Meta live-test continuation on 2026-08-09: the merchant completed Meta's recipient OTP
for the verified test recipient. The first official Graph send failed truthfully with
Meta error `133010` (`Account not registered`). The test sender was then registered
through Meta's `/register` API; the generated six-digit registration PIN is stored only
in the local ignored Hermes environment as `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_REGISTRATION_PIN` and is not
included in this ledger or repository. Registration returned `success: true`.

The approved Meta `jaspers_market_order_confirmation_v1` test template was accepted
with provider message ID
`wamid.HBgMOTE4OTA0MTE3NzY4FQIAERgSMDYxNkMzNjU3ODNCRTRCRjY2AA==`. Meta's test-webhook
panel then displayed two real `messages` events for that exact ID at
`2026-08-09 19:44:26 IST`: status `sent`, followed by status `delivered`. These are
real outbound/provider events, not an inbound merchant intake. Hermes still reported
zero accepted inbound messages.

The merchant WA-ID was absent from the Hermes Cloud allowlist even though two legacy
identities were present. It was added without recording the number in this ledger,
and Hermes was restarted successfully with HTTP 200 `whatsapp_cloud` health. The prior
quick tunnel had expired during the flow. Replacement foundation origin
`https://sara-version-try-vic.trycloudflare.com` is healthy, and the Worker settings API
confirmed that `HERMES_ORIGIN_URL` now points to it while all 15 bindings remain. A
merchant reply is still required to prove live inbound signed delivery and Hermes
intake. The quick tunnel remains unsuitable for external onboarding.

Inbound provider evidence on 2026-08-09: Meta's test-webhook panel recorded two real
events from the OTP-verified merchant after the outbound template was delivered. The
first was text `START BAKERY` with provider message ID
`wamid.HBgMOTE4OTA0MTE3NzY4FQIAEhggQUM0RDZEMDA5OUY3NDIzQTY4NEUwRDM1NUZDMzFERkEA`.
The second was a WhatsApp voice note (`audio/ogg; codecs=opus`) with provider message ID
`wamid.HBgMOTE4OTA0MTE3NzY4FQIAEhggQUM0OTBEMjE1Q0IxQjdEQzUxNDVGOTMzODRDRDQ0RUEA`.
No attachment URL or merchant number is stored in this repository or ledger.

This is authoritative Meta event evidence, but it is **not yet Hermes receipt proof**:
after the events, both local and tunneled Hermes health remained HTTP 200 with
`accepted=0`, `duplicates=0`, and `rejected_signature=0`. The merchant has now been
allowlisted and the gateway restarted, so sender policy is no longer the missing
configuration. The Worker-to-Hermes leg for these two real events remains open for
diagnosis; neither event is claimed as ingested or transcribed.

AWS/Hermes readiness audit on 2026-08-06: the AWS CLI was not installed, no `AWS_*` environment credential names or configured profiles were present, and boto3 returned `credential_source_present False`. Consequently no AWS API mutation ran and no stack, EC2 instance, S3 bucket, IAM role, or external ID is claimed. Static source review confirmed `infra/aws/cloudformation.yaml` declares a `t3.small` host, encrypted 24 GiB gp3 root volume, a security group with egress and no ingress, a private AES-256/versioned S3 bucket with 30-day current/noncurrent expiry, and IAM limited to Polly synthesis plus that bucket's objects. An isolated `cfn-lint` installation attempt timed out and was terminated; authenticated `validate-template` remains required before deployment. Local Hermes reports `v0.18.2 (2026.7.7.2)`, upstream `392e3a8c`, local `88a58ff1`; the version-controlled `proofgate` skill was installed as a junction into the active Hermes home and `hermes skills list` reported it `local / enabled`. The gateway remained stopped and no message was sent.

AWS/Hermes re-audit on 2026-08-08: the AWS CLI remains absent, there are no AWS environment/profile credentials, and boto3 again returned no credential source; no AWS API or mutation was attempted. Local Hermes is `v0.18.2 (2026.7.7.2)` at carried commit `88a58ff1`; a moving remote-tracking revision is not used as the deployment pin. The signed `v2026.7.7.2` tag resolves to commit `9de9c25f620ff7f1ce0fd5457d596052d5159596` and declares `v0.18.2`. The old infrastructure pin `fb402106` was inspected and declares `v0.20.0`; the template was corrected before deployment. The ProofGate skill junction target and installed file hash both equal `7E0A80988DC85DA22E6D7DC849407D7B55CD2A5175A2C4962449E03BC80FB553`, and Hermes reports it local/enabled. The active environment contains only legacy `WHATSAPP_*` Baileys keys and zero `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_*` keys; local “WhatsApp configured” is therefore not Meta Cloud readiness. Gateway status is stopped, cloudflared is absent, FFmpeg is present, and no message or public gateway was started.

Local foundation verification on 2026-08-06: a clean `npm ci` completed from the regenerated lock, TypeScript passed for the application and Convex growth module, 3 legacy tests plus 53 Vitest tests passed, and Wrangler successfully bundled the Worker in dry-run mode with the declared private R2 binding. This is repository/build evidence only.

Historical Cloudflare/Convex deployment audit on 2026-08-06: `npx wrangler whoami`
returned `You are not authenticated`; no Cloudflare or Convex provider environment
variables, `.env.local`, Wrangler profile, or Convex profile were present. Therefore no
Worker, R2 bucket, KV namespace, Convex project, or Convex deployment was created or
claimed. Wrangler dry-run produced the Worker bundle (741.84 KiB / 125.06 KiB gzip)
with the declared `PROOFGATE_ASSETS` R2 binding, and strict TypeScript compilation of
`convex/schema.ts` plus `convex/growth.ts` passed. CLI-validated account-owner commands
are preserved in `infra/cloudflare/README.md` and `infra/convex/README.md`; these are
local validation receipts, not external deployment evidence. This historical state was
superseded by the 2026-08-08 provider foundation update above.

## Development gate evidence

- Production-path hardening on 2026-08-13 rejects unknown customer credential fields in both `BusinessBriefV1` and `SiteSpecV2`; regression tests specifically cover `customerApiKey` and `customerAccessToken`. The intake boundary strips authenticated server identity fields before parsing strict merchant input. Full local verification passed TypeScript, 3 legacy tests, and 98 Vitest tests (101/101 total).
- Cloudflare Worker version `bf89666b-4e1e-4b6e-9ec2-319450e2a8b7` is deployed at `https://proofgate-whatsapp-growth.proofgate-harshita.workers.dev`. A fresh public check returned HTTP 200 for `/`, title `ProofGate — WhatsApp growth agent`, heading `Your business online. No dashboard needed.`, and `/health` phase `whatsapp-growth-p0` with status `ok`.
- The signed-in Cloudflare dashboard accepted the name `proofgate-hermes-production` and reached **Setup Environment / Waiting for your Tunnel to connect**. No connector has connected, Continue remains disabled, and no durable tunnel is claimed. This step is intentionally left at the connector boundary until the approved AWS host exists; the current quick tunnel/laptop origin remains foundation-only.
- Production hosting hardening on 2026-08-13 added an authenticated loopback Hermes origin. It accepts only `POST /whatsapp/webhook`, compares the Worker proxy secret in constant time, caps the body at 2 MiB, preserves the exact Meta body and `X-Hub-Signature-256`, removes the proxy secret before forwarding to Hermes, and exposes only a minimal health response. Focused tests passed 4/4; a real local service smoke check returned HTTP 200 health and HTTP 401 without the Worker credential.
- The AWS path includes a fail-closed PowerShell deployer, commit-pinned Linux runtime installer, restricted systemd services, and pinned cloudflared `2026.7.3` binary SHA-256 `9d71c677db00134c1bd4144b7783486b654ad281b1ea62b4972098d19f770f17`. The deployer requires an authenticated AWS identity, validates CloudFormation, waits for SSM, installs an exact pushed 40-character repository commit, and never accepts merchant credentials. These source/static receipts preceded the live foundation deployment recorded below; no named-tunnel connector is claimed yet.
- Clean `npm ci`, TypeScript, 3 legacy tests, and 107 Vitest tests passed (110/110 total). `npm audit --omit=dev` reports zero production vulnerabilities after upgrading Hono to the fixed release line. Cloudflare Worker version `ef4f59e4-783b-4dc5-a54c-abb14425bf0f` was then deployed; fresh root/health/CSP checks passed and a wrong webhook verification token returned HTTP 403.
- Customer-facing rebrand on 2026-08-13 changed the public and WhatsApp identity to **Axcas** while retaining ProofGate as the internal verification engine and preserving all stable commands, headers, approval IDs, infrastructure names, and callback URLs. Full verification remained 110/110 passing. Worker version `71974026-a4dc-4854-ae13-504376929df0` deployed successfully; the live root returned HTTP 200, title `Axcas — WhatsApp business agent`, seven Axcas brand references, no visible `ProofGate` brand element, and the existing CSP.
- AWS foundation deployment on 2026-08-13 used an authenticated root CloudShell session in `ap-south-1`; STS identified account `917394547881`. The first CloudFormation validation failed before resource creation because `IamInstanceProfile` had the wrong object shape. After that template error was corrected, the next `proofgate-foundation` stack attempt rolled back because `SecurityGroupEgress` was specified without `VpcId`; the rollback completed and no EC2 instance from that attempt survived. The corrected stack then reached `CREATE_COMPLETE`. Its receipts identify EC2 instance `i-06057ce3046b446de` and private recordings bucket `proofgate-foundation-recordingsbucket-k7meu4p2bug6`. The completed template provisions an encrypted 24 GB EBS volume, an outbound-only security group, Systems Manager access (the instance reported `Online`), Polly IAM access, and private encrypted recordings storage.
- The AWS host now runs exact repository commit `9c5835baf4ec55fce6d9ec10bbf8dc1d2cedfa35` with Hermes `v0.18.2`, `aiohttp 3.14.1`, and `httpx 0.28.1`. The Hermes gateway, authenticated origin, and foundation quick-tunnel services are active. Loopback gateway health on port `8090` reports platform `whatsapp_cloud`, Meta verify token and app secret configured, FFmpeg available, and accepted/duplicate/rejected-signature counters all zero. Loopback origin health on port `8080` reports `ok`. The install first failed on host permissions; correcting the permissions allowed it to continue. The gateway then diagnosed missing messaging dependencies; installing the pinned `aiohttp` and `httpx` versions and restarting resolved that failure. Node 18 emitted `EBADENGINE` warnings during that earlier installation. The host was subsequently upgraded from the official `nodejs.org` tarball to Node `v22.23.2` with npm `10.9.8`; its SHA-256 verification returned `OK`, and the restarted origin is active with health `ok`. The repository CloudFormation now pins the same official Node tarball and checksum for reproducible hosts.
- Bootstrap cleanup was verified after installation: all three known S3 bootstrap object versions were permanently deleted, and `list-object-versions` for prefix `bootstrap/` returned no `Versions` or `DeleteMarkers`. The exact CloudShell paths `/home/cloudshell-user/.hermes-upload.env`, `/home/cloudshell-user/.env`, `/home/cloudshell-user/hermes-prod.env`, `/home/cloudshell-user/origin-prod.env`, and `/home/cloudshell-user/tunnel-token` were each checked and absent. No secret value is recorded in this ledger.
- Cloudflare account inspection found no domains or subdomains available for a hostname route. The staged named tunnel consequently has zero routes and remains inactive. The AWS foundation quick tunnel at `https://propose-mainly-operator-disabled.trycloudflare.com` externally returned authenticated-origin health `ok`; a direct unauthenticated POST to its webhook returned HTTP 401. Cloudflare `PROOFGATE_CONFIG` KV key `hermes_origin` was changed from the prior laptop quick URL to this exact AWS quick URL, and dashboard readback confirmed the exact value. This proves temporary AWS external reachability and the fail-closed origin boundary, not a durable production origin.
- A locally signed synthetic empty Meta envelope POST to the public Worker returned HTTP 200 with an empty response after the AWS quick-origin cutover. Hermes' accepted counter remained zero because the fixture contained no message entry. This is a synthetic Worker-to-AWS transport check only; it is not live Meta delivery, a received WhatsApp message, merchant intake, or external-message proof.
- After the reliability timeout fix, application typechecking passed and the full suite passed 3 legacy tests plus 109 Vitest tests (112/112 total). Current readiness is 96% for controlled beta and 94% for external production. A custom domain/named route and a real second-merchant live Meta intake remain blockers.

- Mandatory development Spike B passed on run `spike-b-20260712095158729-e1282552` with a consenting external merchant. Convex independently verified the signed submission, Hermes recorded recipient-bound Telegram provider message ID `20`, the external merchant consumed the single-use capability, and the deterministic projection returned `green / EXACT_EXTERNAL_ACKNOWLEDGMENT` with submitted, dispatched, and acknowledged predicates all true. Evidence: `evidence/spike-b/spike-b-20260712095158729-e1282552.json` and `evidence/spike-b/spike-b-20260712095158729-e1282552-completion.json`. This passes the mandatory development gate but does **not** count as final production or judging evidence.
- Earlier development Spike B runs `spike-b-20260712084907167-13815d3f` and `spike-b-20260712085751067-cefc221a` remain preserved. Run `...cefc221a` received a genuine external acknowledgment, but its pre-hardening dispatch identity format did not satisfy the recipient-bound oracle and is not counted as the passing gate run.
- Failed Spike B attempts `spike-b-20260712084657685-ee6a54d9` and `spike-b-20260712084701490-833d51fe` are preserved with the real `spawn EINVAL` failure. The dispatcher now invokes the Convex JavaScript entrypoint through the active Node runtime instead of spawning `npx.cmd`.
- Oracle hardening rejects mismatched nonce correlation, recipient identity, event windows, unauthenticated dispatch, and replayed booking sessions. These are code/test facts only, not external proof.
- Hardened Convex functions were deployed to the existing development deployment at 14:32 IST. Temporary Worker version `f600bce2-6a27-4691-a3cb-9fb6d3d8462a` was deployed at `https://proofgate-spike-a.roasted-joke.workers.dev`; `/health`, `/s/saturday-sessions`, missing-token `/ack`, and gray `/proof/saturday-sessions` were checked live. This remains temporary development infrastructure, not final evidence.
- At 14:41 IST, the development Convex deployment was updated so subject/session issuance no longer writes a `submitted` event. `oracle:submitBooking` must independently verify the signed request, nonce, time window, stored session binding, and replay state before appending `submitted`. Local verification is 3 legacy tests plus 17 Vitest tests with clean TypeScript. No fresh external run was created, so this is hardened development code only.
- A bearer-link click later appended an `acknowledged` row for run `spike-b-20260712085751067-cefc221a`. It has no Telegram provider update ID and does not independently authenticate the clicker, so it is preserved as development evidence only. After redeploying the current policy at 15:21 IST, the live projection correctly returned `submitted=true`, `dispatched=false`, `acknowledged=true`, passport `amber`, reason `EXTERNAL_ACKNOWLEDGMENT_PENDING`; the old dispatch identity does not match the canonical bound recipient.
- Full verification at 15:17 IST passed 3 legacy tests and 18 Vitest tests with clean TypeScript. Live smoke checks returned HTTP 200 for `/health`, `/s/saturday-sessions`, and `/proof/saturday-sessions`; missing-token `/ack` correctly returned HTTP 400. The proof route remains truthfully gray.

## Session receipts log

| Timestamp | Session id | What was built | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-12 13:11 IST | `20260712_130611_5d7887` | Full Bible read; readiness and Hermes capability audit; Spike A public Worker + capability-scrubbed verifier | Spike A had one preserved HTTP 500, then three consecutive passes in fresh contexts. |

## Truthful fallbacks in force

- Cloudflare authentication and the named Worker exist; public HTTPS, foundation proof, and the GET verification protocol have now responded successfully. This is foundation evidence, not merchant acceptance.
- Convex File Storage is the current no-card private-asset fallback. It is capped at 16 MiB and is not an R2, signed-URL, or unlimited-storage claim.
- Convex development and production are deployed. Mandatory historical Spike B remains development evidence and does not establish current WhatsApp acceptance.
- The historical `bygone-piper`, `roasted-joke`, and quick-tunnel URLs are not substitutes for verifying the current named Worker.
- ElevenLabs and Linkup credentials are absent. No provider claim is made.
- Dodo live mode is unavailable; booking acknowledgment remains the core external-oracle path.
- The passing development Spike B binds the consent-receipt reference, canonical Telegram recipient hash, provider message ID, signed session, exact quantity, immutable version/spec hash, and external merchant acknowledgment. Team/local actions still cannot satisfy the real-witness predicate.
- Preserved Spike A failure: `evidence/spike-a/failures.ndjson` records an actual transient HTTP 500 on attempt 2 before the successful three-run sequence.
- Historical quick tunnel `https://rides-min-logos-finger.trycloudflare.com` served the old Saturday Sessions page on 2026-07-12. It was ephemeral and is not current ProofGate evidence.
